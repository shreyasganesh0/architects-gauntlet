# The Architect's Gauntlet: A Global-Scale Creator Platform
This project is the backend for a global-scale creator platform, designed to support features inspired by YouTube, Twitch, and Patreon. It's built from the ground up to handle millions of concurrent users, petabyte-scale media storage, and complex asynchronous workflows, all while adhering to modern cloud-native architectural principles.

This repository is a living document of that process, showcasing production-grade infrastructure, code, and design patterns.

## Core Architectural Principles
This system is built with a specific engineering philosophy. The key principles guiding its construction are:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): All cloud infrastructure is defined declaratively using Terraform. There is no manual "click-ops" configuration. This ensures our environment is repeatable, version-controlled, and auditable.

- Principle of Least Privilege: Every component, from IAM roles to security group rules, is granted only the absolute minimum permissions required to perform its function. This minimizes the "blast radius" of any potential security vulnerability.

- Decoupled Control & Data Planes: Services on the control plane (e.g., API Gateway, Lambda) handle lightweight authorization and orchestration. The heavy lifting of the data plane (e.g., video uploads) is offloaded directly to specialized services like AWS S3.

- Serverless First: We prioritize using managed, serverless components (API Gateway, Lambda, S3, Cognito) to reduce operational overhead, improve scalability, and optimize costs.

## Current Status & Features
The platform is currently in Phase 1: The Front Door.

### Implemented Features:

âœ… Secure Content Ingestion: A secure API endpoint that provides authenticated users with a time-limited, single-use S3 presigned URL for direct video uploads.

## Architecture Diagram
This diagram shows the flow for the currently implemented Secure Content Ingestion feature.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go (v1.21+)
- Terraform (v1.5+)

## AWS CLI

- Deployment
Clone the repository:

```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd architects-gauntlet
```

- Configure AWS Credentials:
  Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with credentials that have permission to create the necessary resources.

```
aws configure
```

- Deploy the Infrastructure:
  Use Terraform to provision all the necessary cloud resources.

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```
